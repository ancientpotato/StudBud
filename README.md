## ***Recap of Design Brief***
This web app is designed for students who are studying a language, in particular Japanese. Supported by background research, the site provides learners with:
 * A **Kanban board** for students to keep track on their notes as studying a language can be overwhelming and breaking down their tasks into manageble pieces can create a consistent study schedule that is key to learning the language.
 * A **pomodoro timer** and a **stopwatch** as it gives students a way to maintain the time they spending since it has been established from research that students learning the language are also busy juggling with personal matters. 
 * A **resource list** is there for beginners to manage their study materials or advanced learners to refresh their memory on concepts.
 * An **audio player** for students to listen to while they are studying where they can either listen to:
    * **Songs** _or_
    * **Podcasts** since research shows that students struggle with their listening skills so having a podcast integration can help them improve on their skills.


## ***Functionality of Website***
Over the course of this development, I came to the realisation that some of the tools that I pitched before that would be included in StudBud would be difficult to implement at my current skill level so compromisations were made in which they were either removed or left on the site as dysfunctional areas.

### **Kanban board** <br>
The kanban board is _mostly_ functional. You are able to add your own tasks and input many details about the task such as the priority, due date, estimated time of completion and the status. When selecting your status, no matter which column you pressed the add task button for, depending on the status you have chosen, it will end up in that column. _(see example demonstation below)_ <br>

What unfortunately doesn't work is editing existing tasks, dragging and dropping tasks and unable to create new columns (but the modal still appears when pushing the button).
